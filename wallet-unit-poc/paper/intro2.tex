% \paragraph{Organization}
% The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:appeudi} introduces the EUDI setting and maps its requirements to our construction, Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} introduces the notation and cryptographic tools, Section~\ref{sec:contribution} describes the technical details of our zkID construction, Section~\ref{sec:security} provides the security analysis and proofs, Section~\ref{sec:benchmarks} reports benchmark results, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

% \subsection{Our zkID}
% We work with SD--JWT credentials, extensions to other formats are straightforward. The construction adds a zero-knowledge layer around the issued credential and is instantiated with Spartan as the proof system and Hyrax-style Pedersen vector commitments; standard zero-knowledge blinding is applied.

% \paragraph{Objects and notation.}
% Let $S$ be the issued credential with messages $(m_1,\dots,m_N)$, per-message salts $(s_1,\dots,s_N)$, hashes $(h_1,\dots,h_N)$, and issuer signature $\sigma_I$ under public key $PK_I$. The wallet public key $PK_W$ is included among the messages. A presentation policy is modeled as predicates $f_1,\dots,f_K$ over $(m_i)$.

% \paragraph{Two relations.}
% Proving is split into two relations with a fixed interface:
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
%   \item Prepare: Once per credential, prove the correct parsing of $S$, that $h_i=\mathrm{SHA256}(m_i,s_i)$ for all $i$, that $\mathrm{Verify}(\sigma_I,PK_I)=1$, and compute a Hyrax commitment $C_m$ to the \emph{message vector} $(m_i)$. This relation is independent of the presentation policy; its proof can be re-randomized and reused.
%   \item Show: For a given policy, prove that each requested predicate $f_j(m_1,\dots,m_N)$ holds and that a live signature on the verifier’s challenge verifies under the wallet public key bound in $S$. Publish a commitment $C'_m$ to the same message vector.
% \end{itemize}
% The link is enforced by checking $C_m=C'_m$ (Hyrax commitment equality), so no auxiliary link primitive is required. Because equality is checked in one group, both relations use the same curve.

% \paragraph{Workflow.}
% Issuance produces $S$ and binds it to $PK_W$. At presentation, the verifier sends a fresh challenge $\mathsf{nonce}_V$; the wallet signs $\mathsf{nonce}_V$ with the corresponding secret key and returns $(\pi_{\texttt{prepare}},\pi_{\texttt{show}})$. The verifier validates both proofs and accepts only if $C_m=C'_m$.

% \subsection{Comparison to alternatives}\label{subsec:comparison}

% \paragraph{Setting the AC Framework.}
% Let us first outline a reference architecture that represents what an anonymous-credential system would ideally look like if it is to integrate smoothly with current infrastructures. 
% In this model, the \emph{Issuer} is treated as a fixed component that continues to use its existing public-key algorithms (such as RSA or ECDSA) and standard credential formats (e.g., JWT or mDL), since it's typically difficult to change once deployed. All additional logic is placed in the user’s wallet and the verifier.

% The wallet is expected to operate in two stages: an offline \emph{Prepare} step, which verifies the Issuer’s signature once using standard libraries, parses and normalizes credential attributes (for example, turning a date of birth into an integer age), and commits to those attributes using a binding and hiding commitment scheme (a cryptographic way to lock values so they can later be revealed or proven in restricted form); and an online \emph{Show} step, which runs per presentation, where the wallet selects only the attributes or predicates required by a \emph{Relying Party}’s policy, proves them in zero knowledge against the stored commitments, and includes a fresh device signature over the session challenge to ensure the proof is tied to the holder’s device.

% A further requirement is \emph{modularity}: each major function, issuer signature verification, attribute commitment, predicate proofs, and device binding, should be defined as a separate module with a clear interface. This separation makes it possible to swap the underlying proof engine (for example, using a SNARK today or a post-quantum proof system in the future) without requiring changes to parts of the system that are costly or impractical to modify. The purpose of this modular view is to act as a comparison framework: it outlines how a deployment-friendly anonymous-credential stack could be structured, making it easier to compare proposals by the modules they cover, the constraints they address, and the trade-offs they make. 

% A summary of them with respect to the AC Framework is presented in Table~\ref{tab:rw-snapshot}.

% \paragraph{BBS-based anonymous credentials.~\cite{baum2024cryptographers}}
% BBS-based anonymous credentials are recommended in public feedback for the EUDI wallet as a way to meet the program’s requirement that presentations must not be tracked, linked, or correlated~\cite{baum2024cryptographers}.
% This work treats a credential as a constant-size signature on a vector of attributes in pairing-friendly groups, as introduced by Boneh–Boyen–Shacham and proven secure for BBS+ by Au–Susilo–Mu~\cite{C:BonBoySha04,SCN:AuSusMu06}.
% A holder then produces zero-knowledge proofs that reveal only the required attributes or predicates; each presentation is freshly generated so separate verifications cannot be linked.
% This matches our reference system view on the presentation side-privacy enforced at the holder with per-session, non-repeating outputs.
% Where these designs differ from our constraints is issuance. To use BBS/BBS+, issuers sign credentials with a pairing-based scheme rather than the RSA or ECDSA schemes used today~\cite{C:BonBoySha04,SCN:AuSusMu06}. To remain compatible with standardized curves such as P-256 while keeping public verifiability, a pairing-free, server-aided variant (often termed BBS\#) allows the holder to prefetch small auxiliary data through an oblivious interaction with an issuer-side helper and later perform non-interactive presentations; the helper data scales linearly with the number of planned presentations~\cite{cryptoeprint:2025/513}.
% In both variants, device binding and revocation checks can be encoded as attributes or verified within the proof so that transcripts and status queries avoid stable identifiers.


% \paragraph{Anonymous Credentials from ECDSA.~\cite{cryptoeprint:2024/2010}}
% This work considers environments where credential issuers already sign with ECDSA on standardized curves (such as P-256) and hash data with SHA-256.
% The main challenge is that proving correctness of an ECDSA signature in zero knowledge is costly with standard proof systems, because the arithmetic used in P-256 and the bit-level operations in SHA-256 do not align well with the fast polynomial techniques (such as number-theoretic transforms, a method that speeds up polynomial multiplication over special fields) that many modern ZK libraries rely on.
% To handle this, the authors introduce custom circuits for ECDSA and SHA-256, and use a layered protocol based on the sum-check technique with a lightweight encoding (Reed–Solomon code) to control proof size.
% An additional “consistency check” ensures that the same hidden signing key is used across both the signature and the hash logic.
% At presentation, the wallet produces a proof for the verifier and the device also signs a fresh challenge (this is the device-binding step: a live signature that ties the proof to the holder’s device).
% In terms of the reference system view, issuer compatibility is preserved, selective disclosure is supported, and device binding is included; however, there is no reusable offline phase, so the full proof is generated at every presentation. The reported costs are about 60\,ms to prove one ECDSA signature and about 1.2\,s for a complete mDL presentation on mobile devices~\cite[\S5.3,\S6.2]{cryptoeprint:2024/2010}, with larger proof sizes and higher verifier effort than systems based on succinct setup-dependent SNARKs.

% \paragraph{Crescent Credentials.~\cite{cryptoeprint:2024/2013}}
% This work considers environments where issuers continue using existing credential formats such as JWT or mDL and their current signing keys, so no issuer-side changes are required.
% Its workflow is split into a heavy one-time Prepare phase and a lightweight per-presentation Show phase.
% In Prepare, the wallet verifies the issuer’s signature, parses the credential into attributes, and creates two reusable artifacts, that is, cryptographic objects the wallet reuses across presentations: (i) a Groth16 proof that these checks were done correctly, and (ii) a Pedersen vector commitment over the attributes, enabling selective disclosure.
% Both artifacts support re-randomization for unlinkability.
% In the Show phase, the wallet re-randomizes the prepared artifacts and attaches only the proofs required by the verifier’s policy, such as proving an age threshold or linking two credentials to the same holder. Device binding can be added at this step by letting the secure element sign the verifier’s challenge.
% In terms of the reference system view, Crescent realizes the two-phase design with reusable offline work and modular predicates, while leaving issuers unchanged. The trade-offs are significant: the Prepare phase is heavy (tens of seconds for JWTs and minutes for mDLs), the scheme depends on pairing-based Groth16 proofs with a large trusted setup ($\approx$ 661 MB-1.1 GB~\cite[\S4]{cryptoeprint:2024/2013}), and the security model is classical only, without post-quantum protection. The Show step, however, runs with low latency-typically 22-41\,ms with $\approx$1 KB proofs, or about 315\,ms with device binding~\cite[\S4]{cryptoeprint:2024/2013}.

% \subsection{Our zkID}

% \kwnote{A table or figure that summarizes the pros and cons of other approaches and ours will be very helpful for readers.}

% Our construction works with standardized credentials (e.g., SD-JWT, mDL) and existing PKI (RSA/ECDSA), so issuers do not need to change their issuance pipelines.
% The zkID workflow follows the two-phase split in the reference view: a one-time Prepare phase and a per-presentation Show phase.
% In Prepare, the wallet verifies the issuer’s signature, parses the credential into normalized messages, computes the associated hashes, and produces two reusable artifacts: (i) zero-knowledge proofs that issuer-side checks and parsing were done correctly, and (ii) Hyrax-style Pedersen vector commitments to a designated message column, supporting efficient proofs over multiple attributes.
% In Show, the wallet proves only the verifier’s requested predicates and includes a fresh device-binding signature. To link Prepare and Show without revealing values, the verifier checks equality of commitments across both proofs; the wallet reuses the corresponding randomness for that session.
% The proving backend is transparent (no trusted setup). It checks the arithmetic constraints with a sum-check–style protocol and uses a small inner-product check to verify commitment openings. For device binding, we choose a curve whose scalar field matches the device’s signature field (e.g., P-256), so the device signature can be verified directly inside the proof without emulation or field translation. 
% In terms of the reference system view, issuer compatibility is preserved, the two-phase reuse is integrated into the workflow, predicates are modular, and there is no trusted setup. The trade-offs are that security currently relies on discrete-log assumptions (not post-quantum) and that commitment equality requires using the same curve across Prepare and Show; the modular interface leaves room to swap in lattice-based commitments when suitable.
